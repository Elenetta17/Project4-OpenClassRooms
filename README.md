Anticipate building consumption needs

## Business case
To achieve its goal of a carbon-neutral city by 2050, my team is taking a close look at the consumption and emissions of non-residential buildings.

Careful readings were taken by Seattle city officials in 2016. 
However, these readings are expensive to obtain, and from those already made, I want to try to predict the CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of non-residential buildings for which they have not yet been measured.

I am also trying to assess the interest of the "ENERGY STAR Score"* for prediction, which is tedious to calculate with the approach currently used by my team. I will integrate it into the modeling and I will judge its interest.

Here is a summary of the mission:

-	Perform a short exploratory analysis
-	Test different prediction models in order to best respond to the problem
-	Analysis of the interest of the ENERGY STAR Score

This notebook is all about cleaning and analyzing data.
